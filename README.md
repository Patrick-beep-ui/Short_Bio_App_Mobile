Open the `App.js` file to start writing some code. You can preview the changes directly on your phone or tablet by scanning the **QR code** or use the iOS or Android emulators. When you're done, click **Save** and share the link!

In case you want to run the project on your own editor (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/#expo-cli), keep in mind you need to install these dependencies:
- npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
- npm install expo-image-picker
